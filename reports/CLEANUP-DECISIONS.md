# Cleanup Decision Log

## Orphaned Images Decision

| Image | Status | Reason |
|-------|--------|--------|
| `blog/images/kai-team.jpg` | KEEP | KAI avatar for future "Meet KAI" section |
| `blog/images/kewl-kai.jpg` | KEEP | Cool KAI image for hero/intro sections |
| `blog/images/landing-page-mobile.jpg` | KEEP | Mobile layout screenshot - useful for documentation |
| `images/day-two-1.jpg` | KEEP | Day 2 blog post assets |
| `images/day-two-2.jpg` | KEEP | Day 2 blog post assets |
| `images/day-two-3.jpg` | KEEP | Day 2 blog post assets |
| `TechQuestv1.png` | DELETE | Old logo (June 2025), obsolete |

*Decision: Keep all images for now - storage is cheap, they're small (<2MB total), and could be useful for future blog posts or site updates. Delete only the obsolete old logo.*
