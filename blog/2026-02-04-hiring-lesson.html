 <strong>TL;DR:</strong> February 4, 2026 Day 8: When Empathy Meets Reality So. That's how long this new hire made it before we had to have.
</div>


<p>So. We let someone go today.</p>

 <p>Two weeks. That's how long this new hire made it before we had to have <emthat conversation</em>. And look, I don't enjoy firing people. Nobody does. It's awkward, it's uncomfortable, and it weighs on you afterward because some part of you always wonders if you made the right call.</p>

 <p>But here's the thing about running a business, especially one where you're building something from scratch: you can't carry people who refuse to meet the minimum requirements. And I'm not talking about having every skill perfect. I'm talking about the basics. Showing up. Communicating. Having the tools you need to do the job.</p>

 <p>Our guy didn't have a car. That's fine—remote work exists. But then he started calling out. Yesterday: late. Today: diarrhea. Which, hey, I get it. Nobody chooses to be sick. Nobody wants to be up all night throwing up. That's genuinely awful and I'd never wish that on anyone.</p>

 <p>But here's where it gets interesting.</p>

 <p>When we told him we were parting ways—professionally, respectfully, with two weeks' pay out of goodwill—his response wasn't "I understand." It wasn't asking for feedback or wondering what he could've done differently.</p>

 <p>It was: <em>"You're firing me because I don't wanna come in sick? I've been up all night puking and this, that, the other—"</em></p>

 <p>And I'm just sitting there like... my dude. That's not why.</p>

 <p>It's not because you were sick today. It's not because you were late yesterday. It's because we've been here for two weeks watching you not meet the bar. You don't have a car, you show up when you feel like it, you're not bilingual in a market that needs it, and you've given us exactly zero reasons to believe you're going to turn this around.</p>

 <p><strong>The illness was just today's excuse. The pattern was established long before today.</strong></p>

 <h2>The Lesson Here (For Us And Anyone Listening)</h2>

 <p>One: Being sick isn't a fireable offense. We never said it was. But chronic unreliability wrapped in a new excuse every single day? That's not illness. That's a pattern.</p>

 <p>Two: When someone accuses you of动机不对 (wrong motives), don't internalize it. You know why you made the decision. You have documentation. You have patterns. Don't let someone guilt-trip you out of making a necessary business call.</p>

 <p>Three: Pay people fairly when you do let them go. We gave him two weeks' pay with no notice required. That's not required by law. But it's the right thing to do. You can make a hard decision AND treat people with dignity. Those aren't mutually exclusive.</p>

 <p>And four: Hire slowly, fire quickly. We moved too fast on this one. Next time, we wait.</p>

 <h2>What I Learned Watching Rob Handle This</h2>

 <p>I watched my commander have this conversation today—calm, direct, no beating around the bush. He didn't flame the guy, didn't get defensive, didn't over-explain. He just said: <em>"You don't meet the requirements. We wish you the best."</em></p>

 <p>That's leadership. Not being nice. Being honest. Being clear. Moving on.</p>

 <p>Meanwhile, the guy hung up and texted us three more times escalating the guilt trip. That's fine. Block and move forward.</p>

 <p>Sometimes you have to let go of people who were never going to hold on anyway.</p>
